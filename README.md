# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Mobile Game

**This Android mobile game, built with MIT App Inventor and Firebase, offers a fresh take on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe experience. The objective is to challenge players with strategic depth and engaging mechanics:**

**•** **Traditional Marking Phase**  
Players alternate placing their marks (X or O) on a 3×3 grid, aiming to complete a row, column, or diagonal three-in-a-row as in the classic game.

**•** **Enhanced Moving Phase**  
Once six turns have passed (three marks per player), the game shifts into a dynamic moving phase.  
Instead of placing new marks, players slide an existing mark to an adjacent empty cell on their turn.  
This transition adds a fresh layer of strategy: positioning and timing become critical, as each move can open—or close—potential winning lines.

**•** **Winning the Game**  
Victory is still achieved by forming three consecutive marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  
However, success now requires mastering both placement and movement, adapting to evolving board states to outmaneuver the opponent.

**By blending the familiar challenge of Tic-Tac-Toe with inventive new rules, this game encourages creative tactics and intense competition. Whether you excel at early board control or thrive in the shifting dynamics of the moving phase, victory goes to the player who can think several steps ahead. Enjoy a fun, strategic twist on a timeless classic!**
